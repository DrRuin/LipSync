# LipSync using Wav2Lip

This repository demonstrates the use of the powerful Wav2Lip model to synchronize lip movements with speech in videos. The deep learning model generates human-like accurate lip sync that enhances the visual appeal of any talking-head video.

## Inputs

We've used the following video and audio for this demonstration:
